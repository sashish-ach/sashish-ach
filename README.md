👋 Hi! I'm Sashish Acharya, an embedded systems enthusiast passionate about firmware development, IoT, and low-level programming. I love working on home projects that involve microcontrollers, sensors, and wireless communication.
🔹 What I'm Learning & Building:

    🖥️ Embedded C & Firmware Development (STM32, ESP8266, bare-metal programming)
    📡 IoT & Wireless Communication (WiFi, Bluetooth, MQTT)
    ⚡ Microcontroller Programming & Peripherals (UART, SPI, I2C, FIFO, Circular Buffers)
    ☁️ Cloud Integration for IoT Projects (ThinkSpeak, Firebase)
    🛠️ Tools: Keil uVision, STM32CubeMX, Visual Studio, Git

📌 My Home Projects:

    🔗 MQTT Client in C – Experimenting with MQTT for embedded devices.
    🔗 ESP8266-Based IoT Sensor Logger – Sending sensor data to the cloud.
    🔗 Bare-Metal STM32 Driver Development – Writing low-level drivers for peripherals.

🌱 Currently Exploring:

    Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
    Power Optimization for Embedded Devices
    Secure Firmware Updates (OTA)
